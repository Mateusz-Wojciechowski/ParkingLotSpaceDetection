# ParkingLotSpaceDetection
Hello,
This project aims to use YOLO algorithm for object detection. The goal is to identify cars and empty parking spaces on a given image. YOLO is a pretrained model so transfer learning is applied, I used a PKLot dataset from Roboflow for this purpose. Both the dataset and YOLO model references are listed below.
